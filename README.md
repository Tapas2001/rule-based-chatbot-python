# Rule-Based Chatbot using if-else

## 📌 Objective
Create a simple rule-based chatbot using Python that responds to user input based on predefined conditions.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Standard Library)

## 📂 Deliverable
- `chatbot_if_else.py`: A script that simulates a simple chatbot.


## 🧠 How It Works
- The chatbot uses an infinite loop to keep the conversation going until the user says "bye" or "exit".
- It responds to basic greetings and questions using `if-elif-else` conditions.
- User input is converted to lowercase to ensure better matching.
- Typing `bye` or `exit` ends the conversation.

## 🚀 Getting Started
